Rules:  

a) The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer&#39;s hand without going over 21;  

b) Face cards(king, for example) are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand. Card`s with number value equals to its number;  

c) Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden (cardâ€™s back is rendered) until the end;  

d) To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn;  

e) If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand;
